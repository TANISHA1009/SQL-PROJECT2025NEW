I recently worked on an SQL assignment where I analyzed a dataset related to books, orders, and customers. Using SQL queries, I extracted key insights to better understand trends, customer behavior, and order patterns.

This project helped me strengthen my data analysis and SQL skills, reinforcing the power of structured queries in making data-driven decisions.

Iâ€™m excited to share the SQL file with my assignment solutionâ€”feel free to check it out! ðŸš€

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Letâ€™s connect and discuss all things SQL & data analytics! ðŸ’¡
